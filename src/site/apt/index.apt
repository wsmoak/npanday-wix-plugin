NPanday WiX Plugin

 The {{{http://wix.sourceforge.net}Windows Installer XML (WiX)}} is a toolset that builds {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer}Windows installation 
 packages}} from XML source code. The toolset supports a command line environment that developers may integrate into 
 their build processes to build MSI and MSM setup packages.

 The NPanday WiX plugin makes it easy to integrate WiX into your NPanday build process.

 The plugin has been developed and tested with WiX version 3.0.5419.0.  It should also work with other versions of WiX, assuming that your .wxs files
 are compatible with the version of WiX that is available on your PATH.

 The integration tests for this plugin are based on the excellent tutorial at
 {{{http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/}http://www.tramontana.co.hu/wix/}}.
